# Project: Optical Neural Network Capstone Portfolio
## Core Objective
Build a high-performance, visually immersive portfolio site to showcase our capstone project: An Optical Neural Network for real-time image-guided surgery segmentation. Design should not be too complex.

## GUIDELINES
DO NOT:
    - have AI slop
    - include usual AI design language (inter, weird neon, weird gradients)
    

## The Vibe & Aesthetic
**Keywords:** Precision, Beautiful, Clean, Interactive.

**Design Philosophy:**
1.  **"The Lab" Aesthetic:** The site should feel like a simple page that YC people would find impressive. Think anthopic, openAI desing language. 
2.  **Visual Storytelling:** Use scroll-triggered animations to explain how light passes through the neural network.
3.  **Micro-interactions:** Buttons and cards should react fluidly to mouse movement (hover states, magnetic effects), but not OVERLY so


## Technical Stack (Preferred)
*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) - for performance and SEO.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS - for rapid, clean styling.
*   **Animation:** Framer Motion - for complex layout transitions.
*   **3D/Visuals:** Three.js / React Three Fiber (Optional, if we want to visualize the optical hardware).
*   **Deployment:** Vercel.

## Inspiration Analysis
I have selected specific websites for inspiration. Do not copy them, but synthesize these specific elements:


**1. Reference: https://ca.pinterest.com/pin/7599893115804293/**

*   **What I like:** An image of an oscilloscope, palette, cool design.
*   **Application ** Follow this palette and design 
**2. Reference: https://bitmortgage.xyz/**
*   **What I like:** The ASCII art (i think?) that changes on scroll
*   **Application:** Would love an element like this. I like the font as well

**3. Reference: https://www.nicoleho.net/**
*   This is a reposaitory of well designed websites. 

**4. Reference:  https://tdingsun.github.io/reading-machines/**
*   **what i like** The fonts and layout are artistically nice

*   repo of things you can use


## Content Architecture
1.  **Hero Section:** Needs to be a "hook." Maybe a visualization of light refraction or a segmented surgery image.
2.  **The Problem:** Visualizing the difficulty of current image segmentation.
3.  **Our Solution (The ONN):** Technical deep dive.
4.  **Progress Timeline:** A vertical or horizontal scroll of our milestones.
5.  **Team:** Professional headshots with links to LinkedIn/GitHub.
6. **Setup** a subpage of the actual physical hardware setup, rendered in 3js
7. **Notes** A link to notion or obsidian where we display our notes
